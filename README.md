# Pacman-game-with-OOP
This is a variation of Pacman developed in python using the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. The game has have some lag due to the fps being capped to a very low fps, although this can be fixed by simply overhauling the collision detection system and then increasing the fps cap. However the main objective of this project was to demonstrate the use of OOP within python and hence, fixing the lag was a low priority.

Libraries used:
* Pyglet
